		    <h1>UPMC Talk on clinical treatment of breast cancer</h1>

			<p>This talk is divided into two parts. The first part is patient case discussion and the second part is a genomic seminar</p>
			<p>The goal of attending such discussion for me is to get familiar with the decision making process in real world clinical senarios.</p>
			<p>When physicians receive a patient, screening exams can be Xray, ultrasound imaging, Magnetic resonance imaging. Based on radiologists' reports, the physician then send patients for pathological examination for certain tissues. After the biospy, the pathologists will view the tissue samples with microscope and put all information she/he observed into the pathology report. Some genetic testing is also practiced. Family disease and patients' medication as well as personal conditions such as smoking status are also kept in the medical record.  All these information is collected and presented to a group of doctors in this meeting. The physician who receives the patient will consult the advice of different experts and make the final decision on the diagnosis and next step to take. Due to the heterogeneous condition of patients, personalized treatment plan is made by taking into account all sorts of information.</p>
			<p>The second part of the meeting is a talk about the classification of variants of uncertain significance. Since I am not familiar with gene therapy, the following knowledge comes from Internet</p> 
			<p>Doctors are increasingly using genetic information about breast cancer cells to categorize breast cancers. These groups help guide decisions about which treatments are best. Breast cancer groups include:</p>
			<p>Group 1 (luminal A). This group includes tumors that are ER positive and PR positive, but negative for HER2. Luminal A breast cancers are likely to benefit from hormone therapy and may also benefit from chemotherapy.</p>
			<p>Group 2 (luminal B). This type includes tumors that are ER positive, PR negative and HER2 positive. Luminal B breast cancers are likely to benefit from chemotherapy and may benefit from hormone therapy and treatment targeted to HER2.</p>
			<p>Group 3 (HER2 positive). This type includes tumors that are ER negative and PR negative, but HER2 positive. HER2 breast cancers are likely to benefit from chemotherapy and treatment targeted to HER2.</p>
			<p>Group 4 (basal-like). This type, which is also called triple-negative breast cancer, includes tumors that are ER negative, PR negative and HER2 negative. Basal-like breast cancers are likely to benefit from chemotherapy.</p>
			<p>Sequencing of a gene can identify variants that are different from the reference sequence, yet not well understood. In contrast to genetic variants that have been confirmed to be associated with increased risk for developing a disease, a Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) has an uncertain relationship to disease. How to deal with VUS still remains as an opent question.</p>
